public class AccessModifiersNotes {
	
	
//	The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
//
//	We divide modifiers into two groups:
//	* Access Modifiers - controls the access level
//	* Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality.
	
	
//	Access Modifiers:
//	For classes, you can use either public or default:
//
//	Modifiers:
//	public	The class is accessible by any other class	
//	default	The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
	
	
//	For attributes, methods and constructors, you can use the one of the following:
//
//	Modifiers:
//	public	The code is accessible for all classes	
//	private	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
//	default	The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
//	protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and super classes in the Inheritance chapter.
	
//	Non-Access Modifiers
//	For classes, you can use either final or abstract:
//
//	Modifiers:
//	final	The class cannot be inherited by other classes (You will learn more about inheritance in the Inheritance chapter)	
//	abstract	The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the Inheritance and Abstraction chapters)	
//	For attributes and methods, you can use the one of the following:
//
//	Modifiers:
//	final	Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
//	static	Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
//	abstract	Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the Inheritance and Abstraction chapters
//	transient	Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
//	synchronized	Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
//	volatile	The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
	
	

//	Final
//	If you don't want the ability to override existing attribute values, declare attributes as final:
//	
	
	
//	Static
//	A static method means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public:
	
//	Abstract
//	An abstract method belongs to an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass:
