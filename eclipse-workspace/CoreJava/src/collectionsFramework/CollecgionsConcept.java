	/* Collections: It is a framework provided by java.
	 * This framework provides many interfaces and there implemented classes inorder to store
	 * group of objects/elements as a single entity.
	 * 
	 * List Interface: The list interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store/insert and access/retrieve 
	 * elements by their position in the list.
	 * 
	 * List interfaces is implemented by 4 classes in java. They are:
	 * ArrayList
	 * LinkedList
	 * Vector
	 * Stack 
	 * 
	 * Out of all these 4 classes LinkedList is the only class which also implements 
	 * the Deque interface apart from List interface.
	 * Hence ArrayList, Vector, Stack are called as Pure implementations of List Interface.
	 * 
	 * ********************************************************************************************************
	 * 
	 * Queue Interface: The Queue is an ordered data structure that allows us to store and retrieve the values 
	 * based on FIFO(First in First Out) principle.
	 * 
	 * Queue interface is implemented by 3 classes in java. They are:
	 * PriorityQueue
	 * ArrayDeque
	 * LinkedList
	 * 
	 * *********************************************************************************************************
	 * 
	 * Set Interface: The Set interface is an un-ordered data structure that allows us to store the unique values into the collection object.
	 * 
	 * Set Interface is implemented by 3 classes in java. They are:
	 * HashSet
	 * LinkedHashSet
	 * TreeSet
	 * 
	 * ******************************************************************************************************
	 * 
	 * Map Interface: 
	 * The Map interface is an un-ordered data structure that allows us to store the data in the form of key value pairs.
	 * Map interface is implemented by 4 classes in java. They are:
	 * HashTable
	 * HashMap
	 * LinkedHashMap
	 * TreeMap
	 * 
	 *
